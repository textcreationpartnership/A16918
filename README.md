1. THE THEATER OF the little World.

    _ Of God. GOD is called in the holy Scriptures by these names; Elohim, Elohah, El, Eli, Elion, Iehouah, Iah, Adonai, Shaddai, Zebaoth, which signifie his name, essence, power, & omnipotencie.

    _ Of Heauen. Heauen is called of Aristotle, the most excelent booke of nature, whose longitude is between both the Poles, latitude from East to the VVest, and altitude from the South to the North.

    _ Of Religion. From the beginning of the creation of th• world, Abell and Cain did religiously sacrifice• God, but Enoch was the first that set downes what manner he should be called vpon.

    _ Of Prayers & Thanksgiuing. The Maker and Redeemer of the world, di• vse great measure in all things, except in praying, wherein hee was alwayes long, which he shewed most cleerely in Gethsemany, where ho• much the more the agonie did oppresse him, 〈◊〉 much the more did he enlarge his prayers.

    _ Of Vertue. The Hebrewes, by reason of the tenne Com•aundements, boasted that they had the cheefest •od, and the summe of all Vertue.

    _ Of Iustice. Betweene the two zodiacall signes, Leo and Libra, is a virgin called Astraea or Iustice, the which in times past dwelled vpon the earth, an• beeing abused and neglected of mortall men, 〈◊〉 tooke ber flight to heauen.

    _ Of Prudence. The Poets, to declare the excellencie of this •ertue, faine VVisedome to be a vvoman, and 〈◊〉 be borne of no mortall creature, but of Iupi••r himselfe; whō Painters so set foorth, that on •hat side soeuer any one beholding it dyd stand,

either before her, or behinde her, hee had a 〈◊〉 sight of her.

    _ Of Temperance. The property of this vertue consisteth in th• things which belong to the keeping of mans li•• in his body, and vsing the pleasures thereof m••derately, being a meane in our seeing, bearing smelling, tasting, and feeling.

    _ Of Fortitude. The vertue of the mind aduentureth nothing •••shly, neyther in a good cause feareth death, be 〈◊〉 in apparaunce neuer so terrible: whose extreames are feare and foolish boldnes.

    _ Of the Soule. The Soule is called Anima whilst it is in the •ody and giueth lyfe, Mens while it mindeth, Animus hauing will, Ratio for that it iudgeth rightfully, Spiritus while it breatheth, & Sensus whilst it feeleth.

    _ Of Clemencie. This vertue by the Grecians is called Philan•ropia, which signifieth the law of mankind, her •ranches are thankefulnes, pitty, and libera•itie.

    _ Of Liberality & Hospitality. Liberality giueth with iudgement, and is the meane betweene prodigality and auarice; hospitality is foure fold, glorious, onely to be well thought of, couetous, entertainment for ones money, curteous, that receiueth our friends, and religious, which cherisheth those that serue God.

    _ Of Patience. This vertue causeth a vvise man to prepare himselfe to entertaine all kind of fortunes therfore God hath so disposed things, that hee will

not suffer man to haue a prescience of thinges to come.

    _ Of Education. There be two ages (as Aristotle saith) wherinto the institution of youth is to bee deuided, namely, from the age of seauen yeeres vntill foureteene, and from foureteene to one & twentie: for they that deuide the ages by seuen, most commonly say amisse, but it is rather meete to follow the deuision of nature, because euery Art and institution, will supply the want of nature.

    _ Of Wit & Memory. A good wit hath three degrees, of hope, of practising, of perfection; the first is in chyldren, the second in young men, in beeing perceiued 3. wayes, by desire to learne, by quicke conceit, by a good memory; The third of perfection, is in the elder sort, when they quickly conceiue, faithfully remember, and fruitfully put in practise those things which they haue learned.

    _ Of Diligence. Diligence hath reference, to the body, and the mind, in the mind, it is study, in the body, labour, and by so much the more the exercise of the mind is painefull, as the vertues of the one excell the other.

    _ Of Constancy & Perseuerance▪ In euery good action aduisedly begun, is required, constancy, and perseuerance, which are called by Tully, the health of the mind, resisting all dolours that seekes to confound it, and contayning in their power, the whole force and efficacie of wisedome.

    _ Of Friendship. The Romaines perceiuing the necessitie of Friendship, shadowed the same in the shape of a young man, whose heade vvas bared, and vpon his breast was written Sommer and VVinter; who hauing his breast open, & putting his finger to his hart, had therein sette, Farre and neere, & on the skirts of his coate were drawn, Life and death.

    _ Of Loue. All the Arts and Sciences of the worlde, may in time be learned, except the Art of Loue, the which neither Salomon had skill to write, nor Asclepias to paynt, nor Ouid to teach, Helen to report, or Cleopatra learne, beeing a continuall Schoolemaister in the hart; whose diuine furies are Propheticall, misticall, poeticall, amatorial; consecrated to Apollo, Bacchus, the Muses, and Venus.

    _ Of Iealousie & Suspition. This griefe of the minde, as it is called iealousie, belongeth onely to matters of loue, and therefore hath to name Zelotypia, the loue of beauty, whose braunches are obtractation, emulation, •nuie, and detraction.

    _ Of Beauty. Beauty is onely humaine, consisting in goodly lineaments and colours well disposed, more per•est in women then men, and yet without fauour ••perfect in both, therefore the graces are called the hand-mayds of beauty.

    _ Of Chastity. This vertue is generally taken for a chastice•ent of the troublesome perturbations of man, 〈◊〉 Varro witnesseth) but is more properly vnder••ode of that power, which in no case will suffer 〈◊〉 body to be polluted or defiled, being an espe•iall braunch of temperance.

    _ Of Fayth & Promises. By this the society of men is only maintayned, vpon this, the authority, power, and safety of Princes dependeth; a vertue without which not onely the parts of Iustice, but also all other vertues are imperfect.

    _ Of Silence & Secrecie. Nature hath placed the tongue betweene the bead and the hart, hauing aboue it the instrument of all the Sences, the eyes, the eares, and nose, obedient vnto reason, to the end it vtter nothing before counsell taken of the inward faculties of the soule, which are Vnderstanding & Reason, seated in the braine.

    _ Countrey or Commonwealth. This generall nurse and mother of mankind, commaundeth of vs a dutie beyond that which we owe to our naturall parents, & of more loue and pietie, whose safetie ought to bee preferred before all affection, riches, and life; sith in her preseruation, all our riches, lands, liberties, and lifes are secured.

    _ Of Pleasure. How so euer by the Latines, Pleasure is interpreted in the worser sence, by the name of Voluptas, the Greekes are indifferent, terming it Hedone, whose deriuation is from sweetnes or

pleasantnes; it is accompanied with delectation, recreation, oblectation, insultation, ill will, &c.

    _ Of Apparell. Nature cannot be surpassed by Art, who many times disdaining that she is prouoked, by how much more the greater force shee is pressed and couered, by so much the more she riseth vp and sheweth her selfe; the naturall deformity of the body, can neither he altered with sumptuous attire, colours, nor odours, but make it eyther more euident to be seene, or more doubtfull to be suspected.

    _ Of Musique & Dauncing. Aristotle would haue youth to exercise them selues in Musique, and to be imployed in those harmonies which stirre vp to commendable operations and morall vertues, tempering desires, greedines, and sorrowes, for so much as numbers and melodies consist in certaine proportions and concords of the voyce; it is the excellent gift of God, and as Art of numbers & measures serueth to Diuinity, so doth the Art of Musique.

    _ Of Wemen. Although Pandora had wisedome from Pallas, eloquence from Mercurie, beautie from Venus, personage from Iuno, and from euery other God some gift, (where-vpon shee is so called)

yet in the nature of a woman, shee brought the whole world to confusion.

    _ Of Marriage. This contract of mariage, called, the contract of God, (as by him first instituted in paradize) is called the bond of mutuall loue and reciprocall affection betweene man and wife, ouer whom he ought to rule, not as the Lord ouer his Seruant,

but as our Lord & Sauior doth ouer the Church, whose indissoluble knot who so seeke to dissunder, combate with the Maiestie of God, damning themselues through a secret alliance which they make with sathan.

    _ Of Parents & Children. God hath formed the mind to the perfect mold of truth and vertue, carrying it farre from vice, wherefore it behoueth Parents to giue their children good education, which once taught, then is their voyage and Nauigation in this world happy, making them thankefull to the occasions of their great good, where otherwise neglected, they abhorre the remembrance of their Parents, when through their damnable liberty and euill examples, they haue beene led away.

    _ Of Sorrow. This vexation of mind, and sicknes of the bodie, is a perturbation altogether contrarie to pleasure; from whence doth spring repentance, sadnesse, freating, lamentation, carefulnes, affliction, mourning, and desperation; this is the last of the perturbations of the minde, beeing in number foure.

    _ Of Lying. This contrary to truth & nature, maketh that seeme very good, which is euill, and causeth the tongue to become a member of iniustice, when it vttereth more or lesse then is indeed; vnder this

vice are contained Deceipt, Dissimulation, Cr••t, Hipocrisie, Idolatry, and cousenage.

    _ Of Slaunder. A wise man keepeth close his eares, when hee doubteth of the vertue and honesty of the person accused, making Reason their diligent Porter and watch, which examineth and letteth in the

reports that be good, and excludeth those that arise from slaunder and detraction, whose Image was excellently described in figures by Apelles.

    _ Of Flattery. This poyson of mans sences and vnderstanding, hath no other scope in the world but deceit, selfe-loue, and ouerweening of ones selfe, yeelneth this large field, cleane taking away right iudgement, and is blind in regard of what it loueth;

the feeders of this humour are more dangerous then Rauens, for they doe but deuoure the bodies of the dead, slatterers of the liuing.

    _ Of Learning. This is the true substance of felicitie, and the efficient cause of wisedom, without which, mans life is death; The which when the Egyptians would signifie, they set downe the picture of dew dropping from the clowdes.

    _ Of Opinion. Among the Philosophers, some were Stoicks, some Academicks, some Peripatetickes, some Epicures; of Lawyers, some Cassians, some Sabians, some Proculeians; among Phisitions, some affect Gallen, some Hippocrates, some Paracelsus; the Iewes had their Esses, Saduces, & Pharises; In the Vniuersities, some are Libertines, some Germaines, some Alexandrians, some Cilicians; in the Church, some Protestants, some Papists, some Puritans, &c.

    _ Of Perigrination. In this most commendable action, two things are to be pr•posed, the profit, and pleasure of trauaile, the la•er, we are too greedy of by nature; the first which belongeth to the mind, is bounded with prudence and good cariage, which if it be neglected, the other two are vnprofitable.

    _ Of Gods & Goddesses. The Auntients deuided their fayned Deities into three powers, of heauen, earth, and water, the first were the disposers and directors of mens actions, some ruled the ayrie Regions, others raigned in hell, and punished offendours, and some were Gods of the mountaines, some of shepheards, some of husbandry, and some of woods; the last sort were Gods of the Sea, some of floods, others of riuers, and some of springs and fountaines.

    _ Of Antiquities. The knowledge of Antiquities, & first inuention of things, was so much in request among the Auncients, that Plinie, Marcus Varro, & Macrobius, (historiographers no lesse graue then true) were in great controuersie, for proouing what things were most auncient.

    _ Of Prophecies, Visions, &c. Sundry Philosophers by speculatiue Astrology, haue foretold many things, that should fall out, following the rules and signes which haue beene accustomed to proceed, and when experience answereth to the cause; otherwise they are not able to foretell ought without lying, & ayding them

selues with Art, long experience, & reuelation of the deuill, to whom they haue wholy abandoned themselues.

    _ Of Maiestie. The fountaine of all excellent manners 〈◊〉 Maiestie, being the whole proportion and figu•• of noble estate, and properly a beauty or comlinesse in the countenaunce, language & gesture• which doth cast vpon the beholders & bearers a fearefull reuerence.

    _ Of Monarchies. A Monarchie, most significatly representeth the diuine regiment, wherin absolute soueraigntie consisteth in one onely Prince, who commaundeth all, and is not to be commaunded of any.

    _ Of the Empire of Germany.

    _ Of the Turkish Empire.

    _ Of the Bishops, Archbishops, Patriarchs, and Popes of Rome.

    _ Of Warre. There is but one iust title of warre ingenerall, that is, necessity, according to the old saying, nulium bellum iustum nisi necessarium; which is iust and necessary two wayes, the one is in defence of the innocent, the other is in reuenge of iniuries.

    _ Of Felicity. Of all the Phylosophers who contended abou•••e chiefest felicity, the Peripatetikes iudgement to be allowed aboue the rest, who said, that it ••nsisted in the goods of nature, fortune, and the •ind; of the first are health, beauty, strength, •ersonage; of the second, riches, loue, nobility, 〈◊〉,  of the third, vertue, who is deuided ••to the foure cardinals. For the gifts of the •ody, looke in the head of beauty.

    _ Of Fame. Fame is one of the parts of good fortune, in the opinion of some Philsophers and of the Poets, fayned to be the follower of vertuous and noble actions, and fitly compared to the shadow wich accompanieth the body, and attendeth vppon true honour, which is the reward of vertue.

    _ Of Feare. This perturbation hath his deriuation from •he mouing of the minde, and Metus (as Varro sayth) is quasi motus animi, a mouing of the mind, for it seemeth that the mind is fled, and the body much terrified, when some euill happeneth towards vs.

    _ Of Ingratitude. Vnder this monster, haue all vices vvith a curse beene comprehended: (omnia dixeris si ingratum dixeris;) most rightly figured in swine, who eate the Acorns, but neuer looke vp to the tree.

    _ Of Treason. The enemy to loyaltie is Treason, a thing of •ll others most odious to God, and among men •east prosperous, as by the euents appeare.

    _ Of Names. The qualities of the minde, whether they bee good or euill, (especially in great personages) commend a perpetuall memory to theyr prosperitie, eyther of theyr honourable fame, or vile infamie; therefore the auncients gaue certaine names to the true deseruers of both.

    _ Of Contemplation. Contemplation hath three degrees, the first is an election & choosing of good before euill; the second is, as it were an habite or inioying thereof indeed; the last consisteth altogether in the mind of man, frō which the true example of all

vertues doe flow In it all good qualities bee inprinted, which impression, the Platonists 〈◊〉Idaeas, being nothing els but inward conception of things.

    _ Of Agriculture. Agriculture, or husbandry, tooke beginning 〈◊〉 our forefather Adams fall, and since in euery succeeding Age hath beene highlie esteemed, whose companion is Labour, the true handmayd of vertue. The vpholders of this Art (as the Poets write) were the last that waxed wicked, and Iustice forsaking the earth, left her last foot-steps amongst husbandmen.

    _ Of Pouerty. This burden, whether it come by birth or some sinister chaunce, is, or ought to bee a meanes to bring man to a ready knowledge of himselfe, an• by this, to a more neere knowledge of God, who sometime sendeth it as a tryall, other-while as • punishment, to the godly first, the burden is light▪ to the repining punished, intollerable, who loose the benefit thereof by their impatience and murmuring.

    _ Of Death. Death is faigned of the Poets, to be the sister of Sleepe, both borne of their mother Night, a Goddesse impartiall and inexorable, as sparing none, and the Aegiptians by an Owle sitting vpon a tree signifie death. This all-killing power, triumphans cedit, and by death is ouercome.

    _ Of Vsurie. Vsury (of some called Interest, but without reason why, sith money let to interest returneth but with his proper summe) the daughter of Couetousnes and Ambition, may well be called a continuall sire, which euer encreaseth through the consuming of such as fall therein. This hath been so odious amongst the Heathen, that the practizers therof haue beene seuerely punished.

    _ Of Prodigality. Prodigality, one of the companions of Ple••sure, is called of the Stoicks a dissolution, or to• much loosing of reuerent vertue, and a token o• him which desireth to be a tyrant; such Lyons (〈◊〉 Aristophanes termeth them) are not to be nourished in a common-wealth, for if they should men must serue to satisfie their appetite, being a greedy of expence, as the couetous of money.

    _ Of Pride. Pride is a sinne of the soule, which is not seene •nd perceiued of any, but of God onely; and

therfore Moses giueth no temporall punishmen• to proude men, but reserued them to the iudgement of God.

    _ Of Enuie. The most auncient vice of the world is Enuy, and that which shall not end vntill the vvorlde end, is Enuie.

    _ Of Wrath. This vice proceedeth from the ouer-much in••med blood about the heart, the which by no •eanes yeeldeth leasure to vnderstand the cir•umstances which reason teacheth.

    _ Of Couetousnes. The better hap a man hath to attaine to riches, the more is he accursed, in being more tormented with the feauers of the mind and vnquietnes. This vice is held to be the roote of all euill, lacking as well those things which it enioyeth, as which it wanteth.

    _ Of Sloth. In this vice, wit, vnderstanding, wisedom, and all honest endeuours are buried, as it were in a graue, from which ariseth the loathsome stench of corrupt manners and disordered life, making of men women, of women beasts, of beasts monsters.

    _ Of Gluttony. This deadly enemy to health, replenisheth th• body with humours, wind, inflamations, distil•lations, and opirations; and change of mea• draweth pleasure out of the bounds of sufficien•cie; Pleasure, in all thinges which pleaseth whereas in simple and vniforme thinges, deligh• neuer exceedeth the appetite and naturall neces•sitie.

    _ Of Lechery. This bewitching euill, beeing an vnbrideled appetite, in whomsoeuer it raigneth, killeth all good motions of the minde, altereth, dryeth, & weakeneth the body, shortning lyfe, diminishing memory, and vnderstanding.

    _ Of Desperation. The last of all the perturbations of the mind, is Desperation, and is of all other most pernicious; this destroyer of all hope of better fortune, entereth so farre into the hart of man, that it maketh him offer violence to himselfe, then the which nothing can bee more dangerous to the soule.

    _ Of the Deuill. The deuill hath diuers names, he is called Diabolus, Daemō, (& of Plato Cacodaemō) Sathan, Lucifer, Leuiathan, Mammon, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Baal, Berith, Belphegor, & Astaroth.

    _ Of Hell. Hell hath likewise diuers names, Infernus, Barathrum, Tartarus, Orcus, &c, from the which there is no redemption.
